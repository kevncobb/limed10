INTRODUCTION
------------

The contributed module Link allows a Drupal 7 site builder to display a link in
plain text. The text displayed is the link's title when there is one, or the
link's URL if there is none.

Since Link was included in core in Drupal 8, it's no longer possible to display
the link's title as plain text. You can however display the link's URL as plain
text. This is where Link Plain Text Formatter comes in, it provides an extra
Link Formatter with the behaviour outlined above.
